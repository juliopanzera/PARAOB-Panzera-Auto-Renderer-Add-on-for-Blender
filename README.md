# PARAOB - Panzera Auto-Renderer Add-on for Blender (Requires Blender 2.80 or newer)
Panzera Auto-Renderer Add-on for Blender (PARAOB) is a tool for automated and standardized multi-viewpoint rendering of 3D models within the Blender environment.

It is designed to support scientific, educational and artistic workflows that require reproducible visualization, consistent camera alignment and uniform lighting across multiple render outputs.

PARAOB addresses common challenges in Blender-based rendering, such as manual camera placement, lighting setup, resolution control and viewpoint consistency, which are often time-consuming and prone to user error. By automating these steps, the add-on enables the generation of standardized renders from predefined viewpoints (front, back, left, right, top, bottom and oblique) using user-defined parameters.

The add-on emphasizes workflow efficiency, reproducibility and low cognitive load, providing a modular and customizable interface that allows users to control lighting, camera distance, background configuration, resolution and output management from a single panel. Implemented as a lightweight Python-based add-on and fully integrated into Blender, PARAOB requires no external dependencies and can be easily installed and used across different projects.

# Demonstration

## Lightning

The image below presents a set of renderings illustrating how the lighting parameter affects the final output generated by PARAOB. In the add-on, the default light intensity is 1.0, a value chosen to provide balanced illumination for most 3D models without causing washed-out highlights or excessive shadowing. When the user selects a value below 1.0, the resulting scene becomes progressively darker, reducing the visibility of surface details. Conversely, intensities above 1.0 produce a brighter scene, increasing the prominence of specular reflections and local highlights.

In addition to intensity, PARAOB allows users to modify the color of the light source, a parameter that directly influences the perceived hue and mood of the rendered scene. Light color in Blender follows a linear RGB system where each channel ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. A neutral white light - represented as (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) - preserves the original material colors of the 3D model, ensuring that illumination changes reflect only variations in intensity. When users apply a colored light, such as red (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), green (0.0, 1.0, 0.0), or blue (0.0, 0.0, 1.0), the corresponding hue is cast onto the object and the environment, altering both the tonal balance and the appearance of specular highlights. Lower saturation values produce subtle color shifts, whereas fully saturated channels generate strong color dominance in the final render.

Each rendering uses Blender’s primitive UV Sphere mesh as the test object and the same light type (Sun), camera distance (5.0), background color (hex = #CCCCCC), output resolution (1920x1080) and material color (hex = #808080). Images (A-C) illustrate three levels of light intensity, all using the same white light color (hex = #FFFFFF) and expressed in Blender units. In (A), the light is set to a low intensity (0.1), resulting in a dimmer scene. In (B), the default intensity (1.0) offers balanced illumination suitable for most rendering situations. In (C), a higher intensity (2.0) produces a brighter and more contrasted appearance. Images (D-F) present three different light colors, under the same light intensity (1.0), all defined using Blender’s linear RGB system, which is normalized between 0 and 1. The examples show: (D) red (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (E) green (0.0, 1.0, 0.0) and (F) blue (0.0, 0.0, 1.0).](paper/figures/figure-3.png)

## Resolution

The values defined in the PARAOB’s output panel (`resolution_x` and `resolution_y`) directly determine the width and height of the rendered image, meaning that the image’s pixel dimensions always coincide with the chosen resolution. Because PARAOB does not perform any rescaling during output generation, the render is produced and saved using exactly these pixel values. As a result, changes to the resolution setting directly influence both the computational scale and the final appearance of the image. Higher resolutions require more memory and processing power, increasing the computational cost of rendering. They also generate larger and sharper outputs, but at the expense of longer render times. In contrast, lower resolutions demand less memory, produce smaller files and render more quickly, although with reduced detail and visual clarity. 

![Rendered outputs at different resolutions generated by PARAOB. Each rendering uses Blender’s primitive Monkey mesh (Suzanne) as the test object. Suzanne is Blender’s official mascot and serves as the standard model for comparison. All images use the same light type (Sun), light color (hex = #FFFFFF), light intensity (1.0), camera distance (5.0), background color (hex = #FFFFFF) and material color (hex = #E70005). Image (A) shows the complete model. Images (B-G) display the same cropped region of this model rendered at progressively higher resolutions to illustrate the effect of pixel density on image clarity. Starting from lower-definition outputs, image (B) corresponds to an HD render (1280×720), followed by (C) in a square 1:1 format at 1080×1080. Increasing in resolution, image (D) presents the Full HD version (1920×1080), while (E) shows the square 2K format (2048×2048). Higher-resolution outputs are illustrated in (F), rendered in 4K UHD (3840×2160) and in (G), which presents the highest tested resolution, 8K (7680×4320). Together, the sequence highlights how resolution influences the visibility of fine details in the rendered model.](paper/figures/figure-4.png)

## Camera distance

The camera distance parameter controls how far the virtual camera is positioned from the target object. This parameter directly affects the scale, framing and perceived spatial depth of the rendered scene. In PARAOB, the default distance is set to 5.0 Blender units, a value chosen to keep most objects fully within view while maintaining a natural sense of perspective. Because Blender relies on a consistent internal unit system, distance adjustments behave predictably across different scenes. Reducing the camera distance brings it closer to the subject, making the object occupy a larger portion of the frame, revealing finer surface details, and increasing the visual emphasis of contour edges. However, extreme proximity can also compress the viewing angle, making the object appear disproportionately large or cropping parts of its geometry. Conversely, increasing the distance places the camera farther from the model, reducing its size in the composition and creating a more spacious scene. Larger distances also diminish the visibility of fine details, since the object occupies fewer pixels in the final output. 

![Influence of camera distance on the rendered outputs generated by PARAOB. Each rendering uses Blender’s primitive Cube mesh as the test object, along with the same light type (Sun), light color (hex = #FFFFFF), light intensity (1.0), background color (hex = #FFFFFF), output resolution (1920×1080) and material color (hex = #E700DB). Images (A-C) illustrate three camera distances, all expressed in Blender units. In (A), the camera is positioned close to the model at a distance of 2.0 units, producing a larger and more prominent object within the frame. In (B), the default distance of 5.0 units yields a balanced view in which the cube is fully visible with standard proportions. In (C), the camera is placed farther away at 10.0 units, resulting in a smaller visual footprint of the object and a wider overall scene.](paper/figures/figure-5.png)

## Background

In PARAOB, the background color is handled as an independent rendering parameter controlled through Blender’s World settings. Although the background itself does not emit light, it plays a significant role in how the rendered object is visually perceived. Neutral backgrounds - such as the default white one (Hex = #FFFFFF), mid-gray (Hex = #7F7F7F), or black (Hex = #000000) - provide predictable contrast conditions and tend to preserve the inherent appearance of the object’s material. A white background offers maximum luminance contrast, mid-gray produces a balanced and natural relationship between object and environment and black often makes the object appear more saturated and visually isolated within the scene.

Colored backgrounds, such as red (Hex = #FF0000), green (Hex = #00FF00) and blue (Hex = #0000FF), introduce additional visual effects that go beyond simple contrast adjustments. At the perceptual level, these backgrounds can cause simultaneous contrast, in which the human visual system interprets object colors differently depending on surrounding hues [@Grasso2025]. Thus, a white object may appear slightly tinted when placed against a strongly colored backdrop, even though its material color in Blender remains unchanged. At the rendering level, background color can also influence the object's appearance due to global illumination phenomena, particularly light bounce and diffuse color bleeding. These mechanisms are part of Blender’s physically based rendering engine and allow surrounding surfaces - including the background - to contribute small amounts of color to the overall illumination of the scene. As a result, strong background hues can introduce chromatic shifts on materials with neutral tones, especially under high-energy colors or in scenes with materials that exhibit moderate reflectance.

![Influence of background color on the rendered outputs generated by PARAOB. Each rendering uses Blender’s primitive UV Sphere as the test object, along with the same light type (Sun), light color (hex = #FFFFFF), light intensity (1.0), camera distance (5.0), output resolution (1920×1080) and material color (hex = #FFFFFF). Images (A-F) illustrate six different backgrounds selected to demonstrate contrast effects against a white material. In (A), the default white background (hex = #FFFFFF) produces minimal contrast. In (B), a mid-gray background (hex = #7F7F7F) provides moderate contrast while preserving neutral lighting perception. In (C), the black background (hex = #000000) maximizes luminance contrast, emphasizing the sphere’s shape. Images (D-F) demonstrate the effect of colored backgrounds, which can subtly influence the apparent tint of the object. This occurs not because of mirror-like reflection, but due to light bounce and diffuse color bleeding in Blender’s rendering engine - where surrounding colors contribute slightly to the material’s overall illumination. Thus, a red background (#FF0000) in (D), a green background (#00FF00) in (E) and a blue background (#0000FF) in (F) each introduce a faint color cast to the sphere, even though its material remains white.](paper/figures/figure-6.png)

## Viewpoints

To ensure consistent visualization, PARAOB incorporates a set of standardized viewpoints designed to generate reproducible and comparable images. The add-on provides seven predefined viewpoints - front, back, left, right, top, bottom and oblique - each corresponding to a fixed camera rotation around the object’s origin. Because all viewpoints are calculated with respect to the object’s center, PARAOB requires models to be correctly positioned at the scene origin (0, 0, 0), preventing misalignment and guaranteeing geometric consistency across outputs.

Each rendering displays a custom 3D representation of a plasma membrane developed by the author for educational purposes [28], using the same light type (Sun), light color (hex = #FFFFFF), light intensity (1.0), background color (hex = #FFFFFF), camera distance (0.3) and output resolution (1920×1080). Images (A-G) illustrate the seven standardized viewpoints implemented in PARAOB. In (A), the front viewpoint presents the model in its primary orientation and serves as the reference perspective. In (B), the back viewpoint shows the membrane from the opposite direction, revealing regions not visible in the frontal view. In (C), the left viewpoint provides a lateral examination of the membrane’s structure, while in (D), the right viewpoint displays the corresponding opposite side. In (E), the top viewpoint reveals the organization of components from above and in (F), the bottom viewpoint presents the inverted orientation of the model. Finally, (G) shows the oblique viewpoint, a three-quarter angle that enhances depth perception and spatial context, highlighting the membrane’s tridimensional arrangement.](paper/figures/figure-7.png)
