   abstract = {<p>Abstract. Today, the use of 3D visualization technologies is one of the key directions in the field of information technologies. The 3D direction has become extremely popular in many fields, such as architecture, interior design, game industry, medicine, automotive and other fields. This method opens up new opportunities for perception and interpretation of information, adding it to a three-dimensional virtual space. The topic of the research work is the creation of a software module (addon) for the Blender3D program, which will provide the user with a library of ready-made materials, divided by categories. This addon has similar functionality to Substance Painter and Quixel Mixer, the main functions of which are to create and adjust materials and textures for imported ready-made 3D models. The addon has its own name "QuickShader" and will provide the user with 8 shaders and 35 PBR materials. Throughout the development of the project, the Waterfall life cycle model was used, stability and a clear structure were put first, which helped to efficiently work through each step of creating an addon for the Blender program. In the conclusion to the scientific work, it can also be noted that the development of a software addon for Blender3D, which includes a library of shader operators and PBR materials, will greatly facilitate the work of users when assigning textures to objects on the scene. A library of shader operators makes it easy to implement and customize shaders for light, glass, and some metals, giving you more control over the visual aspect of the scene. PBR materials provide realism due to the accurate representation of physical properties using Physically Based Rendering technologies. This addon gives users the ability to interact more effectively with procedural materials, providing a quick means to create realistic renders. This module automates the creation of materials by providing a list of prepared shaders and textures that can be applied to scene objects. The user will be provided with a set of ready-made shaders (glass, light material, metals) and PBR materials (wood, fabric, metals, and others), which can be applied with one button on the module panel.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Learning Cell Biology is challenging for both sighted and visually impaired students due to its abstract nature and reliance on bidimensional depictions in textbooks, which often fail to capture the biological complexity of cell structures and functions. To implement inclusive learning environments and address the shortage of learning materials for both sighted and visually impaired students, this work aimed to design, apply, and evaluate learning tools based on digital technologies, using the principles of Educational Design Research. 3D models representing cell membranes were created and embedded in an online virtual reality (VR) environment equipped with audio descriptions and an innovative color‐changing interface. Models were also optimized for embedding in an augmented reality (AR) environment on social media. Notably, our work is the first to create such an extensive library of both animate and static VR and AR‐based material, covering the structural composition of the membrane, transport mechanisms, and detailed representations of membrane specializations. Additionally, we provided, in an unprecedented way, a systematic description of our results to serve as a roadmap for easy replication and adaptation within the educational community, fostering the creation of new learning tools and approaches. Evaluation of learning tools was conducted with sighted and visually impaired students from biological and health‐related undergraduate courses, as well as experienced and early‐career Cell Biology teachers. Data revealed positive attitudes toward visual presentation, ease of use, content quality, and effectiveness, underscoring the potential of VR and AR to improve inclusive Cell Biology learning for undergraduate audiences.</p>},

   abstract = {Relying on three-dimensional rendering technology to achieve comprehensive innovation of art space, so that it shows a more colorful, vivid image and unique artistic style. In this paper, when constructing virtual art space with Unity 3D platform, texture mapping is used to give the information of two-dimensional spatial points to three-dimensional virtual space points through mapping relationship, so as to enhance the details and readability of three-dimensional scene modeling of virtual art space. And the smoothness of the texture mapping scene is enhanced by the Poisson editing texture leveling and color leveling algorithm, and the texture mapping brightness is enhanced by combining with the coloring illumination model to promote the detailed expression of the virtual art space. The deep neural 3D rendering technique is established by combining the body rendering, neural radiation field and deep residual network, which is applied to the rendering reconstruction of the virtual art space, and the wavelet reconstruction algorithm is introduced to compress the rendering file to improve the rendering efficiency. The Normal value of the texture mapping of the virtual art space is only 0.182cm, and the average brightness enhancement in the texture mapping process can reach 79.58%. The average chamfer distance of 3D surface reconstruction for different virtual art space scenes is 0.636, and the frame rate is maintained between 36.54fps~86.35fps for different scene resolutions and diffusion simulation iterations. The use of 3D rendering technology can give the virtual art space more realistic artistic details, and the faster rendering performance can create artistic expression that is more in line with the concept of artistic aesthetics.},

   abstract = {<p>Simultaneous color contrast is a perceptual phenomenon in which a target stimulus appears to change its hue due to color induction from the surrounding background. In this study, we investigated whether this phenomenon is influenced by the structural complexity and identity of the stimuli used. In Experiment 1, we created two sets of stimuli varying in structural complexity and asked participants to perform a color-matching task on the achromatic target. Low-complexity targets consisted of simple squares, while high-complexity targets were stylized cars. The results showed that high-complexity stimuli triggered stronger color induction from the background and exhibited greater interindividual variation in perceived color saturation. Conversely, low-complexity stimuli were predominantly perceived as achromatic across all participants. In Experiment 2, we further explored whether these effects were influenced by differences in the stimuli’s topology and identity. Topological factors were controlled by ensuring similar organizations of stimulus elements across conditions, while the role of stimulus identity was examined by including a condition in which the high-complexity stimuli from Experiment 1 were presented in a scrambled arrangement, preventing recognition. The results demonstrated that color contrast increased with the complexity of the stimuli but also highlighted the role of identity, as the condition where the car was recognizable elicited the strongest color induction. We conclude that simultaneous color contrast is strengthened by factors that pertain to both the complexity of the stimuli used and their identity.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Efficient rendering of photo‐realistic virtual worlds is a long standing effort of computer graphics. Modern graphics techniques have succeeded in synthesizing photo‐realistic images from hand‐crafted scene representations. However, the automatic generation of shape, materials, lighting, and other aspects of scenes remains a challenging problem that, if solved, would make photo‐realistic computer graphics more widely accessible. Concurrently, progress in computer vision and machine learning have given rise to a new approach to image synthesis and editing, namely deep generative models. Neural rendering is a new and rapidly emerging field that combines generative machine learning techniques with physical knowledge from computer graphics, e.g., by the integration of differentiable rendering into network training. With a plethora of applications in computer graphics and vision, neural rendering is poised to become a new area in the graphics community, yet no survey of this emerging field exists. This state‐of‐the‐art report summarizes the recent trends and applications of neural rendering. We focus on approaches that combine classic computer graphics techniques with deep generative models to obtain controllable and photorealistic outputs. Starting with an overview of the underlying computer graphics and machine learning concepts, we discuss critical aspects of neural rendering approaches. Specifically, our emphasis is on the type of control, i.e., how the control is provided, which parts of the pipeline are learned, explicit vs. implicit control, generalization, and stochastic vs. deterministic synthesis. The second half of this state‐of‐the‐art report is focused on the many important use cases for the described algorithms such as novel view synthesis, semantic photo manipulation, facial and body reenactment, relighting, free‐viewpoint video, and the creation of photo‐realistic avatars for virtual and augmented reality telepresence. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the social implications of such technology and investigate open research problems.</p>},

However, standard tools may be insufficient for 3D scientific visualization. In particular, single‐source illumination of 3D models may be deficient for topographically complex terrains. We present an approach for 3D terrain modeling with multiple‐source illumination in the virtual environment of the Blender free and open‐source software. The approach includes the following key stages: (1) automatic creation of a polygonal object; (2) selecting an algorithm to model the 3D geometry; (3) selecting a vertical exaggeration scale; (4) selecting types, parameters, a number, and positions of light sources; (5) selecting methods for generating shadows; (6) selecting a shading method for the 3D model; (7) selecting a material for the 3D model surface; (8) overlaying a texture on the 3D model; (9) setting a virtual camera; and (10) rendering the 3D model. To illustrate the approach, we processed a test DEM extracted from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean version 3.0 (IBCAO 3.0).

This article aims to understand why blind users use these plugins, as well as how these plugins are developed, deployed, and maintained. To this end, we conducted an interview study with 14 blind users to gain individual perspectives and analyzed 2,000 online posts scraped from three plugin-related forums to gain the community perspective. Our study revealed that screen reader users rely on plugins for various reasons, such as to improve the usability of screen readers and application software, to make partially accessible applications accessible, and to receive custom auditory feedback. Furthermore, installing plugins is easy; uninstalling them is unlikely; and finding them online is ad hoc, challenging, and sometimes poses security threats. In addition, developing screen reader plugins is technically demanding; only a handful of people develop plugins. Unfortunately, most plugins do not receive updates once distributed and become obsolete. The lack of financial incentives plays in the slow growth of the plugin ecosystem. Further, we outlined the complex, tripartite collaboration among individual blind users, their online communities, and developer communities in creating a plugin. Additionally, we reported several phenomena within and between these communities that are likely to influence a plugin’s development. Based on our findings, we recommend creating a community-driven repository for all plugins hosted on a peer-to-peer infrastructure, engaging third-party developers, and raising general awareness about the benefits and dangers of plugins. We believe our findings will inspire HCI researchers to embrace the plugin-based distribution model as an effective way to combat accessibility and usability problems in non-visual interaction and to investigate potential ways to improve the collaboration between blind users and developer communities.</p>},
